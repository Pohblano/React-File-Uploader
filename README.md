# React-File-Uploader
This is a reboot of my JS-File_Uploader. Recreated the site in React, styled up, and adding the capabilities to preview files before the are chosen to be downloaded.

## Notes
Tried to include a chat feature utilizing Sockets.io, but unfortunately the cohort ended before I could complete the task.
